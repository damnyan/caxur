# Initial Concept
Maintenance and enhancement of the core boilerplate features of the Rust Axum Clean Architecture Boilerplate.

# Product Guide

## Primary Objective
The project aims to maintain and enhance a robust, production-ready boilerplate for building REST APIs in Rust using Axum, SQLx, and Tokio. It focuses on providing a solid foundation following Clean Architecture principles and implementing best practices.

## Target Audience
- **Junior Rust Developers**: Provides a guided architecture and clear examples to learn from.
- **Senior Rust Developers**: Serves as a quick-start template for production-ready applications.
- **Small Teams and Startups**: Facilitates rapid development of MVPs with a reliable base.

## Core Goals
- **Production-Ready Foundation**: Offer a rock-solid, secure, and performant base for any web application.
- **Best Practices**: Promote and demonstrate best practices in Rust development and Clean Architecture.
- **Reliability and Quality**: Maintain high test coverage and ensure the boilerplate remains stable and reliable.
- **Feature Completeness**: Provide a comprehensive set of common web application features (authentication, validation, error handling, etc.) out-of-the-box.

## Key Focus Areas for Enhancement
- **Security**: Strengthening authentication flows and adding features like rate limiting and multi-factor authentication.
- **Observability**: Improving system visibility through advanced tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry), metrics (e.g., Prometheus), and structured logging.
- **Developer Experience (DX)**: Creating tools and documentation to make it easier for developers to build on top of the boilerplate.
- **Performance**: Ongoing performance tuning, benchmarking, and optimization of core components.
- **Domain Logic Examples**: Extending the provided examples to cover more real-world use cases.

## Immediate Priorities
1.  **Strengthening Security**: Implementing rate limiting and exploring additional security layers.
2.  **Improving Observability**: Integrating standardized metrics and enhanced tracing.
3.  **Performance Tuning**: Conducting benchmarks and identifying potential bottlenecks.
